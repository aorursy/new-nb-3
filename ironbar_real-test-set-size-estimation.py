    Simulates the submissions that we are performing on the public leaderboard

    

    Parameters

    ----------

    n_submissions : int

        Number of submissions to be made

    public_ratio : float

        Fraction of the test set that belongs to public leaderboard

    full_mask_ratio : float

        Fraction of the submission that will use full_mask

    score_scale : float

        A factor for scaling the score. Typical value is 0.361, which is the score for using

        full mask on all the submission instances
